The different parameter values used in runs are reported in Chapter 5. Variability Case Study. However, occasionally parts of the code had to be changed (e.g., the migration function was disabled in the non-migration scenarios). The alterations were no more of 2-3 lines of code in each case and they are all preserved in the commented out sections of the code. }
